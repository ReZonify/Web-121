    <p>Being able to display images on a personal or business website is a great way to create a theme, display previous work or display products for customers to buy. From a broad standpoint deciding how one wants to display images on their site can seem like a stressful task but thanks to today’s technology it is easier than ever to create and incorporate custom image galleries (Cincopa).</p>
    <p>What used to be a daunting task has become something fun in the web design process. Thanks to the web developers of the world their plenty of pre-built web galleries that you can simply cut and paste into your code and instantly reap the results of a professionally build image gallery. Web designers will face one of two choices when going the pre-built rout. Either pick to pay a website such as Cincopa a membership to access its galleries (this usually comes with many other features that can be used on your website including tech support for those items) or you can go the free route on places like github ( you will be on your own as far as support).
    </p>
    <p>For those do it yourselfers who wish to go the free route there are plenty of resources that can guide a developer through building one from scratch. A great resource for this and really any web development questions is w3schools. They provide how-to instructions to create slideshow galleries, tab galleries, portfolio galleries and many more. The site provides step by step instructions and example code that is easy to follow and imitate. For visual learners there are plenty of videos on Youtube that instruct how to create web galleries from scratch. A popular Youtube personality, Clever Techie has multiple videos on how to create image and video galleries for a website. The risk of creating galleries is that you will not have much support with your code and SEO. </p>
    <p>Be sure that the code used is modern enough to work responsively across different kinds of devices (tablet, desktop, cell phone) and browsers to ensure the best user experience possible.</p>
