    <p>In today’s world we rely on our phones for accessing all kinds of information. Having all this information at your fingertips makes life so much easier when searching for the best local pizza or a museum you want to check out. This makes one wonder “why do some company’s websites not work well on my phone?”. The answer is not as simple as some might think.</p>
    <p>When a person or business is deciding to build a website they are faced with the choice of whether they want to build a responsive website or mobile focused design. Sites that have items for sale will use a responsive design because that business expects their customers to access their page from all kinds of devices. </p>
    <p>A responsive site will automatically adjust its design based on what device you access it on, whether it be through you cell phone, tablet or personal computer the page will adapt its style and presentation to fit that device’s needs. These types of sites will display large amounts of information and have multiple pages (Brennan). It will usually have an option to access the full desktop version of the website. 
</p>
    <p>A mobile website tends to have a smoother interface with less options and information. The idea behind this design is to create a great user experience and to show that they are up to date with modern technology. Most users will not recommend a business with a poorly put together mobile site. The drawback to this sleek design is that oftentimes some of the features of the website will not be available and with less text SEO can be impacted as well. 
</p>
    <p>The ultimate question a business needs to ask is who are my customers and how will they access my website. If your customer base is people from the ages 18-35 you can bet most of your users will be finding you on their cell phones. 51% of all Americans say that their mobile phone is their main browsing device (Corona). If the business’s customer base covers a much larger range including those in their 50’s and above the business will see an increase in customers accessing the site with desktops and tablets as those devices for those who are more familiar with them.
