    <p>This category is for any party who has suffered an injury who is looking for legal representation for medical malpractice,justice for veterans, device/product liablity, auto collisions and wrongful death. The majority of potential clients will be cell phones or tablets to do their browsing when looking for an attorney. Over 50% of users have a mobile device as their main form of internet browsing. The demographic is very broad since these situations can happen to anyone. The site will need to be a responsive site not a mobile first site because the attorney site will be looking to display large amounts of information such as legal scenarios and practice specialties and mobile is not the most optimied platform for doing just that.</p>
