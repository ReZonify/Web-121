<h2 class="pageID">Shopping Carts</h2>
<section>
    <p>The fact that I can still order dinner, buy a designer suit and download the latest video game in under 30 minutes all from my couch using my phone laptop is absolutely mind blowing. Technology has brought everything we could ever need right to our fingertips thanks to places like Amazon.com and Uber eats (Miva). I can confidently say there is nothing worse than going to a retail location with the hopes of picking an item up only to find out it is either out of stock or at a store 35 miles away. With online shopping you can simply access a store with a mobile device or computer and see in real time any and all items that are available for sale without having to trust an uninformed employee at a brick and mortar store.</p>
    <p>Every website should incorporate some kind of online shopping cart that allows the exchange of money and information between the customer and the business. The shopping cart allows a customer to group multiple items they wish to purchase in one action. The shopping cart will collect the items they wish to purchase, calculate the cost and display everything in a visual list for the customer to see, creating a headache free shopping experience without having to interact with a single person.</p>
    <p>Adding a shopping cart to a website is easier than ever. In the past companies would have to hire freelance developers or have an in house team construct one from scratch. Today you can use free ones made by developers on places like github.com or you can go the paid route and look up one of the many companies that offers the use of their pre made online shopping cart code. Going the free route is always a great idea as long as you are comfortable with doing all the trouble shooting yourself. The paid route will give you access to not only their shopping cart but their tech support as well that can help website creators troubleshoot any issues (Snipcart).</p>
