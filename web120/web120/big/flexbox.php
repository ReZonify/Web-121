    <p>                 For years web design has been using floats to organize and shape items on a web page to make the user experience as smooth as possible. Behind the signs a lot of complicated code goes into creating a float-based layout. Each selection needs a series of commands to find its place on the page. With Flexbox this is easier than ever to customize the layout of a web page with simplicity and accuracy.  It has quickly become a developer favorite because “it gains simple and powerful tools for distributing space and aligning content in ways that web apps and complex web pages often need.” (Andrew).</p>
    <p>                What is Flexbox? Flexbox is a modern way to organize and style the containers on a web page. Flexbox consists of two different kinds of items: Flex Containers and Flex Items. Flex containers are self-explanatory, it is the container that houses web content and a flex item is the content pieces themselves.  Flex containers are the parent element and Flex item is the child element. The features of Flexbox allow you to easily control the alignment, direction, order and size of each flex container and Item.
    </p>
    <p>                 Flexbox has only a small set of tools that are extremely powerful and simple to use. To control horizontal structure, use the justify-content property with a value of flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between or, space-outside. These commands will allow you to move your flex items along the horizontal spectrum of a container. Vertical changes can be made by using the align-items property paired with flex-start, flex-end, center, or stretch. Wrapping items is easier than ever with the application of the flex-wrap property and a value of either wrap, or nowrap (easy right?).  To choose between a row or column view add a property of flex-direction and a value of row or column. Lastly stretching flex items, to stretch an item use the flex property with a numeric value to shrink or stretch (James).</p>
    <p>                 Flexbox has made what used to be a daunting task of creating complicated floats with lots of property value combinations to simple straight forward commands that automatically adjust based on the perimeters it is provided. This creates a great visual experience for the user and is a great tool for any web developer to add to their tool belt.</p>
